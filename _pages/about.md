My name is Seraphine Hauser and I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at ETH Zurich.

The focus of my research is on large-scale and synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics in the extratropics. Particularly, I am interested in the dynamics and process-understanding of atmospheric blocking and its link to weather variability, in exceptional large-scale forecasts on the medium-range from the perspective of weather regimes and in the role of diabatic processes for high-impact cyclone development.

I gained my Bachelor's degree in Meteorology at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany) in spring 2017 with a focus on the synoptic-scale dynamics of a dust storm on the Arabian Peninsula in spring 2015 in my bachelor's thesis. I continued onto the Master's program at KIT where I systematically evaluated the influence of El Ni√±o on precipitation variability in Australia from a weather system perspective and graduated in summer 2019. As part of the Collaborative Research Center 'Waves to Weather', I developed during my PhD program at KIT a novel quasi-Lagrangian framework based on potential vorticity to study the relative importance of dry and moist processes in blocking formation and maintenance from the perspective of large-scale weather regimes in the North Atlantic-European region. In 2024, I have been a postdoctoral research scientist working with both the University of Oklahoma and the University of Wisconsin-Madison on the characteristics of large-scale forecast busts on the medium range over Europe. Since March 2025, I work at ETH in a project on cyclone dynamics using high-resolution models.
