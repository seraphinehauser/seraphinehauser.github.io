My name is Seraphine Hauser and I am currently a Postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Oklahoma (Norman, USA) based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Madison, USA). The focus of my research is on large-scale and synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics in extratropics. Particularly, I am interested in the dynamics and process-understanding of atmospheric blocking and its link to weather variability. My current postdoc project is broadening my interests to occasional very poor medium-range forecasts (so-called 'forecast busts') and how deep learning can be used to understand and predict the occurrence of 'forecast busts'.
