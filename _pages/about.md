My name is Seraphine Hauser and I am currently a Postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Oklahoma (Norman, USA) based at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Madison, USA). 

The focus of my research is on large-scale and synoptic-scale atmospheric dynamics in the extratropics. Particularly, I am interested in the dynamics and process-understanding of atmospheric blocking and its link to weather variability. My current postdoc project is broadening my interests to occasional very poor medium-range forecasts (so-called 'forecast busts') and how deep learning can be used to understand and predict their occurrence. 

I gained my Bachelor's degree in Meteorology at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT, Karlsruhe, Germany) in spring 2017 with a focus on the synoptic-scale dynamics of a dust storm on the Arabian Peninsula in spring 2015 in my bachelor's thesis. I continued onto the Master's program at KIT where I systematically evaluated the influence of El Ni√±o on precipitation variability in Australia from a weather system perspective and graduated in summer 2019. As part of the Collaborative Research Center 'Waves to Weather', I developed during my PhD program at KIT a novel quasi-Lagrangian framework based on potential vorticity to study the relative importance of dry and moist processes in blocking formation and maintenance from the perspective of large-scale weather regimes in the North Atlantic-European region. My defense was followed by a short postdoc period at KIT and since January 2024 I have been a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Oklahoma.
